### Introduction

This Android project shows the transactions related with products of a company. The data source is a JSON file that is parsed and read to get all the transactions related with each product.

All the transactions can be shown in a detail screen with their original values and the converted values to GBP currency.

#### Tecnical details

This project follows the Clean Architecture principle purposed by Uncle Bob. The implementation is divided into three modules as Fernando Cejas propose in his github [repository](https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture).
